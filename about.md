I'm Stefan. I'm a web developer working at a startup in Austin.
In my free time I work on a game, a game that I'm for now calling Ripple.
This will be a place for me to write about all the aspects of game development that I'm working on and all the discoveries I'm making (that are interesting enough to blog about) along the way.
Stay tuned.

If you're looking for a description of the game, Ripple, I'll be adding an "About the game" section soon but in the meantime you can check out my ["announce" blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/development/lets-call-it-ripple/).
