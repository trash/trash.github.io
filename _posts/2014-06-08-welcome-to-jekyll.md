After much toiling I've started a blog for the game I'm currently working on.

I'm not certain on what will populate this fetid pit of the internet but it will most likely revolve around games, game development, writing code all day every day, and maybe some off topic stuff about how I'm a general piece of trash human.

Now it's time for a beer. Cheers!
