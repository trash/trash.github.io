One of the biggest changes I glossed over fairly quickly in my [last blog post](/development/return-of-the-jedai/) was the introduction of the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern to Ripple's codebase. For this blog post I thought I'd dive in a little deeper into what the ECS pattern is and what my specific recipe for baking it into Ripple's code looks like.

<p class="note" markdown="1">While most of my blog posts are targeted at anyone who is interested in the game, this is a more technical post and will focus on programming architecture and implementation details.</p>

## What Is ECS?

Well let's take a step back and give some context for why the ECS pattern exists and what problems it addresses.

### Composition Over Inheritance

At its core the ECS pattern boils down to ["composition over inheritance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance). If you've ever taken a software architecture course or have been programming longer than a year it's a design principle you've probably ran into before. Basically whenever you rely heavily on inheritance trees, given enough changes, you'll end up in a situation where adding a new class requires refactoring large parts of the tree to allow the new class to fit into the existing hierarchy. In short, inheritance is often not very flexible.

<p class="note" markdown="1">If you're looking for a more a thorough overview of how to introduce the ECS pattern and what problems it solves I would take a look at the [Component chapter](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html) from the wonderful [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) book by Bob Nystrom.</p>

An example from Ripple's development was when I was thinking about adding a `StorageCart` class to the game. I already had a `Building` class which encompassed the relevant functionality like storing items inside the building and having the building be constructed. This seemed like a good class to inherit from because a storage cart does both of those things. But a storage cart is slightly different in that it also can move, whereas a building cannot. Well, buildings can't move but I had an `Agent` class that *did* have this behavior.

At this point, I had several choices on how to implement the `StorageCart` class if I wanted to stick with the object-oriented, class hierarchy approach:

1. Have each class be separate. This is obviously the worst choice as it requires duplication for every shared piece of functionality.
    <div class="small-image">
        <img src="/images/2017-01-01/oop-figure1.png"/>
    </div>

2. Have the `StorageCart` class extend the `Building` class. The `StorageCart` class ends up sharing most of the `Building` functionality but then has to duplicate the movement-handling code from the `Agent` class. Again, not great because there's still duplicated code.
    <div class="small-image">
        <img src="/images/2017-01-01/oop-figure2.png"/>
    </div>

3. Pull all the shared functionality between the `StorageCart` class and both the `Agent` and `Building` classes out into some shared class, `EntityThatDoesEverything` and then have all three clases inherit from `EntityThatDoesEverything`. While, there's no duplication with this solution there are two problems. 1) The child classes end up doing nothing. 2) Given enough classes being added, `EntityThatDoesEverything` will in fact do everything and thus will turn into a bloated, monolithic class. Not great.
    <div class="small-image">
        <img src="/images/2017-01-01/oop-figure3.png"/>
    </div>

None of these seem great so let's try out the "composition over inheritance" approach. If we did that, instead of having classes inherit their functionality from their class or their parent-class, the functionality would be encapsulated as a separate class by itself. Given the previous example then `StorageCart` and `Building` would both have storage functionality because they would instantiate an instance of the `Storage` class.

### OK But Where Does ECS Come In?

I mentioned you could separate out different pieces of functionality into different classes and then have those classes attached to your entities. If we did this with every piece of functionality our entity classes would essentially be nothing more than an id and pointers to other classes that implement all of their needed functionality. This is core of the ECS pattern.

<div class="small-image">
    <img src="/images/2017-01-01/composed-object.png"/>
</div>

To be more explicit, the core parts of the ECS pattern are Entities, Components, and Systems. And in ECS, this id **is** the Entity. Components are raw data representing one piece of functionality for Entities (`Position`, `Health`, `Storage`) and are tied to each Entity by its id. Systems, which are aligned to a specific type of Component, operate on each Component of their type every turn (`StorageSystem` operates on `StorageComponents`).

## Ripple ECS Architecture

If you're not familiar with ECS that super brief intro might have confused you but I figure it will be more illuminating to explain each piece as it exists in my implementation so I'm not repeating myself. So let's jump in.

<p class="note" markdown="1">I imagine there are a whole bunch of different ways to implement the ECS pattern so, *caveat emptor*, this is just one way of implementing it.</p>

#### Entities

The first pieces of the puzzle are entities, the most simple concept to grapple with. An entity in ECS is an id with a number of components tied to it. When I say a component is tied to an entity's id I just mean, given the id, you can fetch any component for that entity. There is no entity class and there are no pointers. Think of it as a primary key in a database.

#### Components

Components are also very simple. They are just structs that represent an entity's state for a given piece of functionality. What does that mean? Well, let's look at an example.

```typescript
interface IHealthState {
    maxHealth: number;
    currentHealth: number;
}
```
This is the interface for the state of one of the simpler components in the Ripple codebase, the Health component. It contains all the relevant data for keeping track of an entity's health. In this case we just need to know current health and the max health. If you wanted to do damage to an entity you would fetch this component and decrement the `currentHealth` value. We'll get to the specifics of how that works in a bit.

You might be confused by the interface being called `IHealthState` instead of `IHealthComponent`. This is really an implementation detail. I decided to have components exist as wrapper objects containing a reference to the actual state and then some extra metadata like the name of the component. This was done to make identifying the components in code a bit easier.<a class="citation">[1]</a> Here's the full file for context to see what I'm talking about:

```typescript
import {ComponentEnum} from '../component-enum';

// This is the component wrapper
export interface IComponent {
    enum: ComponentEnum;
    name: string;
    state: {[key: string]: any;}
}

// The state for the HealthComponent
export interface IHealthState {
    maxHealth: number;
    currentHealth: number;
}

export interface IHealthComponent extends IComponent {
    state: IHealthState;
}

// The HealthComponent with default values instantiated (null)
export const Health: IHealthComponent = {
    name: 'health',
    enum: ComponentEnum.Health,
    state: {
        currentHealth: null,
        maxHealth: null
    }
};
```

<p class="note" markdown="1">When working with components in Ripple you'll almost always be working with instances of the `state` property on the `Component` class. The wrapper mostly exists for the overall ECS implementation behind the scenes.</p>

#### Systems

We have our Entity ids and Component state objects so where do Systems come in? As I said before, a System is associated with a specific type of component and is in charge of performing any necessary updates on components of that given type. For instance you might have a `PoisonComponent` and a `PoisonSystem`. The `PoisonSystem` might check the `PoisonComponent` of a given entity for an `isActive` flag and then decrement the health value for that entity every turn.

<p class="note" markdown="1">Not every component needs to have a system associated with it. A system only needs to exist if a given component requires an update method to check it every turn. For example, the `HealthComponent` I showed has no associated System in Ripple. It is mostly manipulated and updated by other Components' Systems.</p>

In its most simple form a System might look like this:

```typescript
export class EntitySystem {
    update (entities: number[]) {
        entities.forEach(entity => {
            // do stuff with entity every turn
        });
    };
}
```

Every turn the System has its `update` method called and is passed in the list of entities of its given type. To reiterate, the entities passed in each have a Component of the given System's type attached to them. A `PoisonSystem` would receive all entity ids for which the associated entity has a `PoisonComponent`.

#### Putting the core pieces together

A simple example showing the interaction between Entities, Components, and Systems in the ECS pattern might look like this:

```typescript
// Generate a new unique id, this is our entity
const entity: number = createEntity();

// Instantiate a HealthComponent and PoisonComponent. Internally
// this will tie the component to the entity with id `entity`
createComponent(entity, HealthComponent);
createComponent(entity, PoisonComponent);

// This is the PoisonSystem
// Somewhere in our game engine code, the `update` method
// will be called every turn and passed in the matching entities
class PoisonSystem {
    update (entities: number) {
        entities.forEach(entity => {
            const poisonState = getComponent(entity, PoisonComponent);
            if (poisonState.isActive) {
                const healthState = getComponent(entity, HealthComponent);
                healthState -= 1;
            }
        });
    }
}

// Poison the entity
// At this point the PoisonSystem's `update` method will start
// decrementing the entity's health
const poisonComponent = getComponent(entity, PoisonComponent);
poisonComponent.isActive = true;
```

#### Assemblages

Well, we've gotten through the core pieces of the ECS pattern but I have some extra pieces that I've rolled into my implementation. The first of these are called Assemblages and are essentially templates for different types of entities.

First, a little context. Let's say we want to have a Ball entity with a Move component, so it bounces and changes position properly, a Render component, so it shows up on the screen correctly, and a Color component, so balls can be different colors.

When you'd construct a Ball entity you'd end up doing something like this:

```typescript
const ball: number = createEntity();
createComponent(ball, Components.Move);
createComponent(ball, Components.Render);
createComponent(ball, Components.Color);
```

That means every time we create a ball we need to construct one of each of these three components. This is pretty tedious and it becomes even more tedious the more types of entities and components you add to the game. This is where assemblages come into play.

An assemblage really is just a list of components that make up a given entity to make spawning them easier. For our ball example it would look like this:

```typescript
const ballAssemblage = [
    Components.Move,
    Components.Render,
    Components.Color
];

// Now we can create a ball in two lines
const ball: number = createEntity();
ballAssemblage.forEach(component => createComponent(ball, component));
```

#### Assemblage Data

Now we have an easy way to create entities of the same type in a jiffy, but what happens if we want to create entities of the same *type* but with different *values* for their components? With our ball example, we have a way to create a bunch of balls with an assemblage very easily but how do we create a bunch of green balls and a bunch of red balls just as easily?

<p class="note" markdown="1">The previous code example would create a Ball with default values for each component. Depending on how you defined your components, this might mean you have a Ball with no color that hasn't been spawned or rendered yet.</p>

First, let's lay out what the components look like and the api for creating components with state values already set:

```typescript
class ColorComponent extends Component {
    name = 'Color';
    state: {
        color: string = 'none';
    }
}

// Method to create a component with state values
createComponent(
    entityId: number,
    component: Component,
    state: any
): void;

// This call would create a ColorComponent for the ball with
// color set to "red"
createComponent(ball, Component.Color, { color: 'red' });
```

With that laid out, the solution is probably pretty obvious. We need to make multiple calls to that `createComponent` method for each Component for a given Assemblage. And for each of those components we need to pass in the desired state values. Sounds like a map might work here.

```typescript
// We're mapping the desired state values for the Color
// component to the "name" property, "Color", on that component
redBallAssemblageData = {
    Color: { color: 'red' }
};

// We can still create a red ball in a few lines
const ball: number = createEntity();
ballAssemblage.forEach(component => {
    createComponent(
        ball,
        component,
        redBallAssemblageData[component.name]
    );
});
```

The key in the above code working is this:

```typescript
redBallAssemblageData[component.name]
```

That line relies on there being a way to tie the component from the assemblage's list of components to the matching data entry in the assemblage-data map. The `name` property on the `Component` interface fulfills just this purpose.

Of course the beauty of this is is you can define your various entities as plain old data-- JSON even, if you make sure to keep your component's state objects composed entirely of primitives.

#### Utils

Systems have methods to perform updates on components but this is only within the context of the System's `update` method. What happens if we want to update a component from outside the System? Or what if a System needs to update a component not of its given type? This is where Utils come in.

Utils are tied to a Component of a certain type similar to Systems but provide publicly accessible methods for performing updates on that component type. They exist as a good location to consolidate logic relevant to a certain Component without tying it to a System, whose methods can't be shared.

One use-case for Utils is for the use of more complicated data structures for your Components' state. Ideally Components should be made up of primitive data structures <a class="citation">[2]</a>. Therefore, since they have no methods attached to them, if you want to use more advanced data structures you'll need a place to store that logic outside the component itself. Utils are a good spot for this code.

#### Entity Manager

The final piece of the puzzle with my specific implementation of ECS is the Entity Manager. This is, as it sounds, a class that manages all entities and all components. It provides an API to create components for an entity, get components for an entity, delete components for an entity, etc. In short a lot of the methods used in the above examples would be on the Entity Manager class: `createEntity()` -> `entityManager.createEntity()`. The Entity Manager is also the one in charge of calling every System's `update` method with the appropriate entities every turn.

### But How Do You Use It?

Those are a lot of pieces and it might be confusing how they come together. So far I've given some  small isolated examples so here's a couple more involved examples that should help paint a more concrete idea of how the architecture is used in practice.

#### Creating a villager in Ripple

The first example is how to create a villager in Ripple. Every call to create an entity begins with a method on the `EntityManager`. In this case that method is `createEntityFromAssemblage`. This call takes care of creating all the required components associated with that assemblage and tying them to the newly created entity. This is basically that `forEach` loop going through each Component in an Assemblage in one of the previous examples.

At this point our entity has all of its components but they are all populated with default data and thus mostly empty. Therefore the next step is to initialize the entity's components with its specific assemblage data, that is, the data that makes a villager a villager. This is fairly simple and involves just a few steps of fetching components and then extending/merging their state values with the assemblage data.

What if we want to spawn a villager with a specific name or some other attribute? Well, just as easily as we merged in the assemblage data we would then merge the user's passed in component values to overwrite the assemblage data. Merging all this data might look something like this:

```typescript
// Merging VillagerComponent data

// Default, empty component data
const defaulComponentData = { eyeColor: null, hair: null };

// Assemblage data i.e. defaults for the villager entity type
const assemblageComponentData = { eyeColor: 'blue', hair: 'red' };

// This would be passed in by the user making the call to spawn the
// entity with their desired component values
const specificComponentData = { hair: 'brown', name: 'Chet Manley' };

// End result with villager entity data extended with user's specified
// data
const entityData = _.merge(defaultComponentData, specificComponentData);
// { eyeColor: 'blue', hair: 'brown', name: 'Chet Manley' }
```

Since a lot of this logic is repeated and most of the time you just want to spawn something of a given type with only a couple attributes changed, I pulled this code out into an `EntitySpawner` class with simple methods like `spawnBuilding(data: EntityData)`.

#### How to move an entity on the screen

If you've read up till this point you probably have a pretty good idea of how to do this. All you need to do is fetch the component in charge of keeping track of an entity's position in game, let's say it's the `PositionComponent`, and then update the coordinates or `tile` of this component's state. But how does this result in the entity actually moving on the screen?

Well obviously this will differ from engine to engine, but from a high level it might go something like this:

1. Update the tile on the `PositionComponent` for the entity.

```typescript
const positionState = getComponentForEntity(
    entity,
    Component.Position
);
positionState.tile = newTile;
```

{:start="2"}
2. `RenderableSystem` in charge of the `RenderableComponent` of the same entity sees the tile changed on the `PositionComponent`.

3. `RenderableSystem` updates the coordinates for the entity's sprite on screen to match up with the new tile.

```typescript
class RenderableSystem {
    update (entities) {
        entities.forEach(entity => {
            const positionState = getComponentForEntity(
                entity,
                Component.Position
            );
            // 2.
            if (positionState.currentTile !== positionState.previousTile) {
                const renderableState = getComponentForEntity(
                    entity,
                    Component.Renderable
                );
                // 3.
                renderableState.position = positionState.currentTile;
            }
        })
    }
}
```

This is a pretty basic example but it highlights a couple key things. First, it shows how systems operate on their components to produce changes in game. In this case the `RenderableSystem` updates the `RenderableComponent` and this causes the sprite to move on screen.

Second, it shows how a component's system can gather data from other components to update the state of components that they are in charge of. Here the `RenderableSystem` uses the state of an entity's `PositionState` to update that entity's `RenderableState`. More explicitly, while the `RenderableSystem` is in charge of updating the `RenderableComponent` it can use data from the entity's other components to update the `RenderableComponent`.

## Pros and Cons

Now that you have have an idea of how the ECS pattern works in practice, I thought I'd take some time to lay out, at a high level, some of the costs and benefits of using it.

### Pros

#### Deterministic updates through immutable state

One of the great things about the ECS pattern is how simple performing and tracking updates is. Updating components is as easy as changing a value on their state. There's no varying api spread across different classes; it's always the same no matter what you're trying to update.

Tracking changes is just as easy. You make a change to a component and then in your System's `update` loop you check to see if the component changed since the last call. If you go a step further and make components immutable [updates become easier to detect and less error prone](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/). Either way there's definitely no reliance on confusing and hard to keep track of event bindings to detect mutations in state.

#### Data-oriented design
Saving and loading information is easy because components are just data. That means in JavaScript land, as long as you stick to primitives, you can dump your entire game's state to JSON via `JSON.stringify`. You could even store it `localStorage` if you want. Loading is just as easy as calling `JSON.parse` on your dumped JSON data and then iterating and recreating entities from the data.

On top of this, adding new types of entities can be as simple as adding a map with some strings and numbers in it. Want to add a green zombie? Well it's probably as easy as just copying and pasting the existing zombie's JSON data and add 'green' somewhere. This means you don't need a programmer to add content to the game.

#### ECS encourages isolated functionality
Since functionality is often isolated, when you go to update a piece of functionality you don't have to worry as much about your changes breaking other functionality.

#### Not hindered by iterative development
ECS is quite flexible so you don’t need to plan out the entire game up front. This is as opposed to inheritance trees where, if you don't plan all your classes up front, adding new ones can be quite costly in terms of development time.

### Cons

#### Boilerplate
Every time I add a new component I have to update a bunch of lists and enums to have it be properly included in all the various pieces a part of the ECS framework. (This is likely an implementation detail and could be reduced if you're clever.)

#### Can be expensive/inefficient if you’re lazy
I mentioned the `update` method of Systems being passed every entity with the given Component of that System's type. Obviously if you don't take care to organize data structures to make that fetch fast you can handicap performance. In addition, if you don't take care to only update the entities you need to you can destroy performance just as easily.

In short, you’ll have to be smart with how you organize the underlying data structures and systems that operate at scale in your ECS implementation.

#### Can be confusing at times
There's numerous cases since I've started working with the ECS pattern where there's ambiguity in terms of whats the best way to do something. Here's some examples of those types of situations.

"Where do updates happen"/"Who’s in charge of what"? In the case of the `RenderableSystem` reading the `PositionComponent` and using it to update the `RenderableComponent`, it could have been done the opposite way i.e. the `PositionSystem` sees the tile was updated and then updates the `RenderableComponent` directly. It's unclear which is better so you'll have to rely on your experience and judgement.

"Who gets to touch what"? It seems clear to me that some components by necessity interact with other components. A `PoisonComponent` probably needs to interact with a `HealthComponent`. Other times it's unclear if components should be kept separate. Having interconnected components can break the isolation that is one of the benefits of using ECS.

"Who goes first?" Order matters when calling the `update` on Systems if you want deterministic code. If they are not called in the same order every time you cannot expect certain values to be updated consistently. Given that fact, sometimes it can be unclear which systems should go before others. For example it seems pretty clear that the system in charge of rendering should go last but other systems can be more ambiguous.

## Final Thoughts

When I initially heard about ECS I thought it sounded a bit too complicated. Why invest in building and integrating a fairly substantial framework and opinionated architecture when objects "just work"? Well an object-oriented approach did "just work" until it "totally did not work". While the object-oriented approach was very fast to get up and running with, the long-term costs in time spent refactoring and rewriting code started to add up till adding certain features became a seemingly insurmountable endeavor. It got to the point where I put off features I absolutely should have been working on just because the thought of breaking yet another core system left me apathetic.

While I'm sure everyone will have a different experience with ECS depending on their personal tastes as a programmer and the type of game they're working on, overall I've found ECS to be a godsend for Ripple's development. Ripple is a simulation game with a lot of interacting systems. ECS has been a huge help by focusing on isolating those various systems. This was a large improvement over my previous object-oriented approach where many classes covered many overlapping domains of functionality leading to confusion and bugs.

On top of this, the flexibility of ECS has been a huge boon as it really fosters iterative development. Now I can easily introduce and try out new features/functionality as components and then get rid of them if they don't work out. This means I spend less time on implementing features that might be a dead-end in terms of fun.

I hope this post convinces some people to try out the Entity Component System pattern or helps some to understand it a bit better. If anyone is interested in *using* my implementation just shoot me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/slowestbro) or via [email](mailto:khalilravanna@gmail.com?Subject=Open%20Source%20Dat%20Ripple%20ECS) and I can get to work on pulling out the code into a github repository.
