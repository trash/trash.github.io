One of the biggest changes I glossed over fairly quickly in my [last blog post](/development/return-of-the-jedai/) was the introduction of the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern to Ripple's codebase. For this blog post I thought I'd dive in a little deeper into what the ECS pattern is and what my specific recipe for baking it into Ripple's code looks like.

<p class="note" markdown="1">While most of my blog posts are targetted at anyone who is interested in the game, this is a more technical post and will focus on programming architecture and implementation details.</p>

## What Is ECS

* Id = entity
* Components are isolated pieces of functionality that exist as bits of state
* Systems operate on each component of the same type as it. AgentSystem operates on Agent components

### Composition Over Inheritance

At its core the ECS pattern boils down to ["composition over inheritance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance). If you've ever taken a software architecture course or have been programming longer than a year it's a design principle you've probably ran into before. Basically whenever you rely heavily on inheritance trees, given enough changes, you'll end up in a situation where adding a new class will require refactoring large parts of the tree to allow it to fit into the heirarchy. In short, inheritance is often not very flexible.

<p class="note" markdown="1">If you're looking for a more a thorough overview of the ECS pattern I would take a look at the [Component chapter](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html) from the wonderful [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) book by Bob Nystrom.</p>

An example from Ripple was when I was thinking about adding a `StorageCart` class to the game. I already had a `Building` class which encompassed the functionality like storing items and being a constructible entity. But a cart should move right? Well buildings can't move but I had an `Agent` class, a parent class for monsters and people, that had this behavior. That means I would have to pull all of that functionality from both classes into a shared class that the `Building`, `Agent`, and `StorageCart` classes inherited from. This doesn't seem particularly elegant. Especially as you can imagine this situation arising over and over until you have a super bloated `EntityThatDoesEverything` top level class.

My halfway solution was to follow this "composition over inheritance" motto directly. If an entity needed storage functionality then it would have a storage property, `entity.storage`, which would be an instance of the `Storage` class. This class would encapsulate all of the functionality around storing items and could be attached to any other entity class.

Now at this point I started to convert pieces of functionality over to this format, where functionality was encompassed in classes that existed as instances of entities. But I realized by doing this I was essentially implementing a half-assed version of ECS. Bored and frustrated, I decided to go whole-ass with my solution and move everything to ECS.

### OK. But Really What Is ECS?

I mentioned you could separate out different pieces of functionality into different classes and then have those classes attached to your entities. If we did this with every piece of functionality what would our entity class be left with? A decrepit vessel for pointers, a husk floating through the void of code. Or maybe just an identifying piece of information, an id.

The core parts of the ECS framework are <small>surprise</small> Entities, Components, and Systems. And in ECS, this id *is* the entity. Components are raw data representing one piece of functionality (`MoveComponent`, `PoisonComponent`). Systems, which are tied to a specific type of Component, operate on each Component of their type every turn (`MoveSystem` operates on every `MoveComponent`).

### Ripple ECS Architecture

If you're not familiar with ECS that super brief into might have confused you but I figure it will be more illuminating to explain each piece as it exists in my implementation so I'm not repeating myself. So let's jump in.

#### Entities

The first pieces of the puzzle are entities, the most simple concept to grapple with. An entity in ECS is just an id with a number of components tied to it. When I say a component is tied to an entity's id I just mean, given the id, you can fetch any component for that entity. Think of it as a primary key in a database.

#### Components

Components are also very simple. They are just structs that represent an entity's state for a given piece of functionality. What does that mean? Well, let's look at an example.

```typescript
interface IHealthState {
    maxHealth: number;
    currentHealth: number;
}
```
This is the interface for the state of one of the simpler components in the Ripple codebase, the Health component. It contains all the relevant data for keeping track of an entity's health. In this case we just need to know current health and the max health. If you wanted to do damage to an entity you would fetch this component and decrement the `currentHealth` value. We'll get to the specifics of how that works in a bit.

You might be confused by the interface being called `IHealthState` instead of `IHealthComponent`. This is really an implementation detail. I decided to have components exist as wrapper objects with a reference to the actual state and then some extra metadata like the name of the component to make identifying them in code and while debugging a bit easier. Here's the full file for context to see what I'm talking about:

```typescript
import {IComponent} from '../entity-manager';
import {ComponentEnum} from '../component-enum';

export interface IHealthState {
    maxHealth: number;
    currentHealth: number;
}

export interface IHealthComponent extends IComponent {
    state: IHealthState;
}

export const Health: IHealthComponent = {
    name: 'health',
    enum: ComponentEnum.Health,
    state: {
        currentHealth: null,
        maxHealth: null
    }
};
```

And here's `IComponent`:
```typescript
export interface IComponent {
    enum: ComponentEnum;
    name: string;
    state: {[key: string]: any;}
}
```

#### Systems

So we have our entity ids and then component state objects, where do systems come in? As I said before a System is associated with a specific type of component and is in charge of performing any necessary updates on components of its given type. For instance you might have a `PoisonSystem` and a `PoisonComponent`. The `PoisonSystem` might check the `PoisonComponent` for an `isActive` flag and then decrement the health value for the entity every turn.

<p class="note" markdown="1">Not every component needs to have a system associated with it. A system only needs to exist if a given component requires an update to be fired every turn. The Health component I showed is an example of this.</p>

In its most simple form a System might look like this:

```typescript
export class EntitySystem {
    update (entities: number[], turn?: number) {
        entities.forEach(entity => {
            // do stuff with entity every turn
        });
    };
}
```

Every turn the System has its `update` method called and is passed in the list of entities of its given type.

<p class="note" markdown="1">In my case I also pass in other things, like `turn` which is the current turn of iteration for the engine. This is useful for things like rendering things in time with the speed of the game.</p>

#### Assemblages

Well, we've gotten through the core pieces of the ECS pattern but I have some extra pieces that I've rolled into my implementation. The first of these are called Assemblages, or templates for entity types.

First, a little context. Let's say we want to have a Ball entity with a Move component, so it bounces and changes position properly, a Render component, so it shows up on the screen correctly, and a Color component, so balls can be different colors.

When you'd construct a Ball entity you'd end up doing something like this:

```typescript
const ball: number = getEntityId();
createComponentForEntity(ball, Components.Move);
createComponentForEntity(ball, Components.Render);
createComponentForEntity(ball, Components.Color);
```

That means every time we create a ball we need to construct one of each of these three components. This is pretty tedious and it becomes even more tedious the more types of entities and components you add to the game. This is where assemblages come into play.

An assemblage really is just a list of components that make up a given entity to make spawning them easier. For our ball example it would look like this:

```typescript
const ballAssemblage = [
    Components.Move,
    Components.Render,
    Components.Color
];

// Now we can create a ball in two lines
const ball: number = getEntityId();
ballAssemblage.forEach(component => createComponentForEntity(ball, component));
```

#### Assemblage Data

Now we have an easy way to create entities of the same type in a jiffy, but what happens if we want to create entities of the same *type* but with different values for their components. With our ball example, we have a way to create a bunch of balls with assemblages very easily but how do we create a bunch of blue balls and a bunch of red balls just as easily?

First, let's lay out what the components look like and the api for creating components with state values already set:

```typescript
class ColorComponent extends Component {
    name = 'Color';
    color: string;
}

// Create a component with state values
createComponentForEntity(
    entityId: number,
    component: Component,
    state: any
): void;

// This call would create a ColorComponent for the ball with
// color set to "red"
createComponentForEntity(ball, Component.Color, { color: 'red' });
```

With that laid out, the solution is probably pretty obvious. We just need a way to map the values we desire our entities to be spawned with to the given components. And that's it.

```typescript
redBallAssemblageData = {
    Color: { color: 'red' }
};

// We can still create a red ball in a few lines
const ball: number = getEntityId();
ballAssemblage.forEach(component => {
    createComponentForEntity(
        ball,
        component,
        redBallAssemblageData[component.name]
    );
});
```

The key in the above code working is this:
```typescript
redBallAssemblageData[component.name]
```

Which relies on there being a way to tie the component from the assemblage's list of components to the matching data entry in the assemblage-data map. The `name` property on the `Component` interface fulfills just this purpose.

Of course the beauty of this is is you can define your various entities as plain old data-- JSON even, if you make sure to keep your component's state objects composed entirely of primitives.
