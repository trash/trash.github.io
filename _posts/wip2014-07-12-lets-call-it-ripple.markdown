I'm making a game.

Well, that's good to get off my chest.

As a part of writing this up I did a little research just to get some stats on how far I've gotten since I started development, and some of them actually surprise me.

My first commit was on May 17th. Which means I've been working on the game for a little bit under 2 months.

In that time I've pushed 240 commits, which in non-git terms means I've added to the codebase 240 separate times. An admittedly pretty ambiguous statement as some of those commits were little more than commenting a function, while others were very large refactors or adding new complex features.

Let's talk about Seinfeld. By now most people are familiar with [the Seinfeld strategy for getting good at something](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret). The "Don't Break The Chain" technique. Since May 28th I've written code for the game every single day. 46 days straight, which of course is my longest streak of writing code every day straight ever. And probably the longest I've worked on anything consistently over a period of time.

Again, some of the code written for a given day was little more than going back and tweaking something or adding a comment, trivial tasks. But I don't think that takes away from the significance of the task, that is consistently doing something every day.

I think this consistency has almost everything to do with this project not disappearing into the aether, and in fact progressing much faster and farther than I might have guess in 2 months time.

So what the hell is the game then?

It's basically what I'd call my dream game. But the fact that I've basically sacrificed my social life by spending all my free time working on the game kind of speaks to that point on its own.

Let's start by explaining some of my inspirations. Then maybe I'll get into a couple of development stories, that is stories that I picture as having the game able to recreate at some point.

By looking at the above screencap you might already have a couple guesses. And if you're in the know about games, you're probably familiar with [Dwarf Fortress]() and might have guessed it. Or maybe you guessed [the Sims](). These would be both good guesses and both sources of inspiration. There are more and I'll start addressing them each directly.

It's out of the scope of this post to go into detail about what each one of these games is but if you're interested, I implore you go do some research on each one if you're not familiar, and doubly implore you to go and try them out if you haven't already.

The shared component of each of these games that I love and that draws me to them is their ability to facilitate dynamic and emergent gameplay with a series of sophisticated but coherent interacting systems. That is to say they're simulations, really good simulations. Every time you boot up a game of Dwarf Fortress you know that there's always a chance you're going to lose. But if you know anything about Dwarf Fortress, losing is winning. No matter what leads to the inevitable fall of your group of dwarves, it will always be the consequence of some ridiculous events you have no control of that, that will almost always leave you happy because you were able to witness the destruction that unfolded. Sure all your dwarves are dead or driven to lunacy, the ephemeral spectres of those who passed haunting the hauls of your once beloved polished stone hallways. You "lost". But, you got to witness it. You saw that first event that set the whole spiral off: that time Urist McDingus took a drink of poisoned water, died, and sent his family on a grief stricken murderous rampage. In this way, you "won". 

The Sims is the same. (Though perhaps a little bit less violent and dwarfey.) For a lot of people it's at its best when you can plop down a variety of interesting characters and watch as drama unfolds in some unpredictable and ultimately interesting series of events. 

Emergent gameplay's strength is in its ability to continually surprise us while still remaining coherent enough that you can always understand *why* something happened. This is an important clarification to drive home. Any one can throw down random number generators all over a games code hoping to make it "interesting" because "Hey, it's random, right?" Randomness on its own isn't fun. That's just chaos for the sake of chaos. Sure anarchy sounds all good and romantic, but nobody really likes an anarchist. They smell and they have questionable music taste. (Don't get me wrong Crack Rock Steady is still a song that still speaks to me.) 

The best game's are the ones that create a world, an environment, that facilitates interesting experiences for the player while not holding the player's hand.
